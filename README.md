I like developing Web Applications and API Integrations, mainly using Nuxt, the Vue framework, and the power of Serverless services to take advantage of their high performance at a low cost.

My passion for computers began at the age of 14. It all started with creating my first blogs and diving into HTML editors, driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. Over time, I began watching tutorials to learn Java and JavaScript, which allowed me to have a brief understanding of coding before starting my degree which is why I performed well in development subjects.

I studied Computer Systems Engineering at the Technological University of Panama. I am deeply passionate about computers and emerging technologies. I have experience in Web and Mobile App Development, API Integrations, Server Administration, System Automation, Database Management, Testing, and Continuous Integration. With my determination, I am confident in my ability to overcome any programming challenge that comes my way.
